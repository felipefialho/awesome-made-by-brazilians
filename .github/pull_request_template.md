(the same measurement rule as [awesome-made-by-russians ](https://github.com/gaearon/awesome-made-by-russians))

It's hard to calculate project popularity so we use stars to measure it. It's not quite fair, but it is what we have here on Github.

If you want to add a project to this list, please make sure that:

- [ ] The project was created by the developers born in Brazil
- [ ] The project can't be just a personal, experimental or sample project
- [ ] The project has more than **100 stars** on Github
- [ ] Place them in alphabetical order
- [ ] One repository per PR/contribution - _avoid conflicts and simplify review_

If they meet the requirements above, feel free to create a PR! 😁
