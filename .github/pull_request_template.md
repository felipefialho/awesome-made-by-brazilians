(the same measurement rule as [awesome-made-by-russians ](https://github.com/gaearon/awesome-made-by-russians))

It's hard to calculate project popularity so we use stars as a measurement. 
It's not quite fair, but it is what we have here on Github.

If you want to add project to this list, please, make sure that:

- The project was created by the developers born in Brazil
- The project can't be just an experimental or sample project
- The project has more that **100 stars** on Github
- One repository per PR/contribution - _avoid conflict and simplify review_
- If they do, feel free to make a PR! üòÅ
